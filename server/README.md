Goal: Create a classification model that will take ADR reports and assigns them a certain level of causality assessment

Input Features
---
The yellow ADR reporting form from PPB

Challenges
---
- Getting real ADR reports that focus on first line antitubercular drugs that have been assigned to levels of causality assessment (Even a small portion can help, synthetic data can be used to increase the dataset size)
Other features

Other Features to come later
---
- Notification for reports with less details

- Data Access
- Engaging PPB


- Clear thinking

includes
- health use case
- health benefit: patient safety
    - why?

big health impact -> 
    patient safety -> pv -> digital health -> ai -> solution

how does tech come in?

PvERS can further be enhanced


- include timelines (due to )
- reduce ambition


> synthetic data vs real data

advise

think of writing a paper
ask for advice for how to write a paper
cite properly


implementation science (applied research)


Update Career PDP
- specific career goal?
- area of AI application?
- surveillance (detecting outbreaks, respond quickly, contain)? (it is a health science)


encouragement
---
- where are the greatest problems?
- clear connection with problem and solution at scale



reading points
---
- surveillance (detecting outbreaks, respond)?
- public health



online courses
---
fundamentals of disease surveillance



do not reeinvent the wheel => refer to pv(for graphs)
